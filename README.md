## Hi there 👋

My name is Siyu Chang!

I’m a full-stack web developer with four years of experience. I may dislike running into bugs, but I love solving them—and helping others debug their code. Even though I’m still a high school student, I’m determined to contribute to the world’s codebase with my own skills.

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just say hi!😊
